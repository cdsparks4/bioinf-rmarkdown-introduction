# Who I am and where I came from

I was born and raised in Anniston, Alabama. I had always wanted to leave
and when friends invited me to move to Colorado in 2010, I gladly
accepted the opportunity. Here I decided to explore academia again but
only had the confidence to get my toes wet. Community College lead me to
an interest in biology which spiraled out of control into a B.S. in
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from Colorado State University, and
then to PhD in Agricultural Biology, which a discipline in molecular
weed science. I was more keen to wet lab until I was introduced to
bioinformatics by inheriting an underutilized RNAseq data set. This
inspired me to look for more data science and computational courses,
such as this one, where I appreciate the biological context ##Put in a
hypertext link to your undergraduate institution.

My favorite leisure activities, like this:

1.  Singing
2.  Hiking
3.  Volleyball
4.  Video Games

This image of me was taken at the Meow Wolf Convergence Station in
Denver, CO. It was an artistic and fun adventure.

# Research Interests

My primary research interests involve exploring the molecular and
biochemical mechanisms of herbicide resistance in weeds and in mutagenic
crop lines.

## Influential papers

In my field we often classify mechanisms of resistance as target site or
non-target site. One early and important paper came from my advisors PhD
work. '@GainesToddA2010GACG' found a now commonly known target site
mechanisms that involves multiple copies of the gene normally inhibited
by the herbicide, in this case 50-200 fold increase, allowing the weed
to easily overcome normal field applications of herbicide. Though it is
unique in *Amaranthus palmeri* for more complex reasons, target site
gene duplication itself has since been found in several species.

On the other hand, resistance is not always caused by any change in the
target site but rather a non-target mechanism. This may be a change in
absorption and translocation of the herbicide, or detoxification through
metabolic processes of enzyme families, as described by
'@YuanJoshuaS2007Nhra'.

## The mathematics behind my research

These equations are commonly used in my field. The first on is the well
known and historically renowned dilution equation. The other is the Hill
equation which we commonly used with dose response curves to calculate
the dose of herbicide that controls 50% of a population.

$$
C_1(V_1)=C_2(V_2)
$$
$$
\frac{E}{E_\max} = \frac{1}{1+{(\frac{EC_{50}}{[A]})}}^{n}
$$
## My computing experience

My computing experience involves many hours but not much expertise. I
have taken the data science courses that are only 1/3 semester. One on
basic linux and one on RNA-seq. I also took the python class, but I did
not enjoy it. I inherited an RNA-seq project that I have spent a lot of
time playing with. I also took the STAT511 which introduced me to some
R-specific computation. I have ran a variant calling pipeline, and a few
other random processes.

## What I hope to get out of this class

Give me a bullet list of three things:

-   Best practices for file management
-   How to use github for reproducibility
-   Learning proper and cool ways to run common commands and
    bioinformatics processes

# Evaluating some R code

Nothing fancy for today but here is a simple set of data and a base r histogram. 
```{r}
x <- rnorm(1500, mean=5, sd=1)
hist(x)

```
